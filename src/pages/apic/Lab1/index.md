## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this lab, we will get a chance to use the IBM API Connect (APIC) Developer Toolkit and its intuitive interface to create a new API using the OpenAPI definition (YAML) of an existing Customer Database RESTful web service.

In this tutorial, we will explore the following key capabilities:

-   Creating an API by importing an OpenAPI definition for an existing REST service

-   Configuring ClientID/Secret Security, endpoints, and proxy to invoke an endpoint

-   Testing a REST API in the developer toolkit

-   Publish an API for developers

## 2. Preparation step: Deploying the REST Services <a name="deploy"></a>

Before we can use API Connect we must publish an API to expose. We will deploy a Customer Database REST service and then we will download the OpenAPI file for the the Customer Database REST service that we deployed.

1\. In a browser, enter the URL for the Platform Navigator that is provided by your instructor.

2\. Select the **Enterprise LDAP**:

![alt text][pic0]

**Note:** You may get a warning message that your connection is not private.  If you get this message, you can add an exception.   Occasionally in Edge on Windows you get a blank screen instead of a warning. If this is the case we recommend that you try a a different browser.

To add an exception in the Chrome browser, click **Advanced** and then click **Proceed** to the URL.

3\. When prompted, use the username and password provided to you for this lab. The username in the screenshots of this lab is chopper12.

![alt text][pic5]

4\. When you log in for the first time, you may see a **Welcome, let's get started** window.  Feel free to review the contents by click **Start the tour** or by click on the **X** to close the window.

![alt text][pic91]

5\. Navigate to the **App Connect Dashboard**.

![alt text][pic92]

6\. Click on the **Dashboard** icon in the left navigation.

![alt text][pic93]

7\. If you would like to create this web service yourself, follow the instructions in the **Using a REST API to manage a set of records** tutorial (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/11.0.0?topic=enterprise-toolkit-tutorials-github).  Otherwise, you can download the **CustomerDatabaseV1.bar** file for the service [here](./resources/CustomerDatabaseV1.bar).

8\. Click on **Deploy integrations**.

![alt text][pic94]

9\. Click **Quick start integration** and click **Next**.

10\. Drag and drop the BAR file that you just downloaded or click to upload.  Click **Next**.

![alt text][pic96]

11\. Click **Next**.

![alt text][pic97]

12\. Give the Integration Server a **Name** (e.g. <span style="color: red">username</span>-customerdb) and click **Create**.

![alt text][pic98]

13\. This will take you back to the Servers Dashboard where you will see your new server. It will likely be showing Pending while it is starting up the pod.

![alt text][pic99]

14\. Note: It may take a couple of minutes to start up. You can refresh the page. Once it is up and running it will show the following:

![alt text][pic100]

15\.  Click on the newly created Integration Server.

## 4. Configure the API <a name="configure_api"></a>

After importing the existing API, the first step is to configure basic security before exposing it to other developers. By creating a client key and secret security, we are able to identify the application using the API.

Next, we will define the backend endpoints where the API is actually running. IBM API Connect supports pointing to multiple backend endpoints to match your multiple build stage environments.

Finally, we will configure the proxy call to invoke the endpoint.

### 4a. Configure API Key Security <a name="configure_security"></a>

## 6. Publish API <a name="publish_api"></a>

In this lab, we will make the API available to developers. In order to do so, the API must be first put into a product and then published to the Sandbox catalog. A product dictates rate limits and API throttling.

When the product is published, the Invoke policy defined in the previous lab is written to the gateway. 

### 6a. Create Customer Product and Add API <a name="customer_product"></a>

1\. From the vertical navigation menu on the left, click **Develop**.

![alt text][pic80]

2\. Click the **Products** tab.

![alt text][pic82]

3\. Click **Add** and click **Product** from the drop-down menu.

![alt text][pic83]

![alt text][pic84]

4\. Click **New product** and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic85]

5\. Enter **Customer** for the **Title** and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic86]

6\. Select the **Customer Database** API and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic87]

7\. Keep the **Default Plan** as is and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic88]

8\. Select **Publish product** and confirm that **Visibility** is set to **Public** and **Subscribability** is set to **Authenticated**.  Click **Next**.

![alt text][pic89]

9\.  The Product is now published successfully with the API base URL listed and available for developers from the Developer Portal.  Click **Done**.
