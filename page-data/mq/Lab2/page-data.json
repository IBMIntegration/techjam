IBM Employees can get from [here](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary). \n* A Github account and token \n\n\t[Go here to create a github account](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)\t\n\t\n\t[To create your github token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\n\n## Steps\n\nOnce you have your gitHub account ready, you can continue with the lab.\n\n## Step 1: Fork this repository\n\n1. Open a web browser by double-clicking on the icon on the desktop.\n\n\t![](./images/image0.png)\n\t\n1. Navigate to the git account **ibm-cloudintegration** with the following URL:\n\n\t```\n\thttps://github.com/ibm-cloudintegration/\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image0a.png)\n\t\t\n\tIf not signed-in, click *Sign in* and login with your personal gitHub ID and password.\n\n\t![](./images/image0b.png)\n\t\n\tIf you receive a message about unsupported browser, ignore the message. It still works for this lab.\n\t\n1. You need to fork the **cp4i-mq-ace-tekton** repository. Make sure you are in the *Repositories* section then click the *cp4i-mq-ace-tekton* hyperlink.\n\n\t![](./images/image0b.png)\n\t\n\tNormally you could just download the code. But each student will be creating a pipeline and making changes to the code, so you will need your own repository.\n\t\n1. In the top right corner of the screen (under your profile) click *Fork*.\n\n\t![](./images/image30.png)\n\n1. You will receive a pop-up with a list of one or more accounts to choose. Click your personal account.\n\n\t![](./images/image31.png)\t\n1. The repository is copied to your account and you are taken to your account with the new repo. \n\n\t![](./images/image32.png)\t\n\n## Step 2: Clone the forked repository onto your machine \n\nNow you can download the code to your desktop. \n\n1. Click the *Code* button and select *Download ZIP*.\n\n\t![](./images/image33.png)\n\t\n1. Click the *Save file* radio button then click *OK*.\n\n\t![](./images/image34.png)\n\t\n\tThe file is downloaded to */home/ibmuser/Downloads/cp4i-mq-ace-tekton.zip*.\n\t\n1.

Then change to that directory.\n\n\t```\n\tmkdir ~/icp4ipl\n\tcd ~/icp4ipl\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image35.png)\n\t\n1. Unzip the downloaded code with the following command:\n\n\t```\n\tunzip ~/Downloads/cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master.zip\t```\n\t\t\t\n\t![](./images/image36.png)\n\t\n## Step 3: Modify and run the install script\n\n1. Change to the *cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master* directory.\n\n\t```\n\tcd cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master\n\t```\t\n\t\n1. Open an edit session using *gedit* for the file *install.sh*. It is in the subdirectory *install*.\n\n\t```\n\tgedit install/install.sh\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image37.png)\n\t\n\tThe editor opens in a new window.\n\t\n1.\tReview the file observing the commands and objects being created. There are a few  changes needed. \n\n\tClick the hamburger menu in the top right corner and select *Find and Replace...*.\n\n\t![](./images/image38.png)\n\t\n1. Enter **00** in *Find* field and your student ID in the *Replace with*. Click *Replace All*.\n\n\t![](./images/image39.png)\n\t\n1. Insert your *git token* and *git usernname*. Insert the namespaces for *MQ_NS* and *PN_NS* (cp4i for this lab). Click *Save*.\n\n\t```\n\tGIT_TOKEN=paste git token here and remove brackets\n\tGIT_USERNAME=paste github username here and remove brackets\n\tMQ_NS=<insert the MQ namespace here>\n\tPN_NS=<insert the Platform Navigator namespace here>\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image3.png)\n\t\n\t**Note**: You should have gotten your gitHub token at the beginning of the lab. If you didn't, you will need to get it now.\t\t\n1. In gedit click *Open* > *Other documents* and navigate to */home/ibmuser/icp4ipl/cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master/tekton/resources/mq-git-repo-resource.yaml*. Click *Open*. \n\n\t![](./images/image4.png)\n\t\n1. Update the *PipelineResource* by pointing to the url of your forked repository on line 8 - replace \"xxxxxxxxxxx\" with your github. Click *Save*.\t\n\t![](./images/image5.png) \n\n1. Open another terminal window and navigate to */home/ibmuser/icp4ipl/cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master/*. Make the install script executable with the following command: \n\n\t```\n\tcd icp4ipl/cp4i-mq-ace-tekton-master\n\tchmod +x /install/install.sh\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image6.png)\n\t\n1. Run the install script with the following command:\n\n\t```\n\t./install/install.sh\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image7.png)\t\n1. Once the *install.sh* is complete return to the Open Shift Console to verify that the pipeline was created. Make sure you are in your mqxx-pipeline project. Click the drop-down for Pipelines and select *Pipelines*.\n\n\t![](./images/image18.png)\n\t\n1. Click the hyperlink for *mq-pipeline*. Explore the various tabs. Pay particular attention to *Parameters* and *Resources*.\n\n\tYou have not defined a *WebHook* yet, so you will receive failed status for *Pipeline Runs*.\n\n## Step 4: Add the route to Github WebHook\n\nFollow steps here to add a webhook.\n\n1. Open a Firefox web browser session by double-clicking its icon on the desktop. \n\n\t![](./images/image8.png)\n\t\n1. Navigate to your fork of the this repository in GitHub and sign-in.\n\n1. Click *Settings* then click *Webhooks*. \n\n\t![](./images/image9.png)\n\n1. Click the *Add webhook* button.\n\n\t![](./images/image10.png)\n\t\n1. If you receive a pop-up to confirm password, enter password and click the *Confirm password* button.\n\n\t![](./images/image11.png)\t\n1. You need to set the Payload URL to the EventListener Route. In order to find the URL enter the following command in your terminal window: \n\n\t```\n\toc get route el-el-cicd-mq-hook-route --template='http://{{.spec.host}}'\n\t```\n\t\n\t![](./images/image12.png)\n\n\tCopy the returned value and paste into the *Payload URL* field. Set the *Content type* to **application/json**. You arenâ€™t using the Secret in this lab, so you can leave it blank.  Select *Just the Push Event* radio button. Click *Add webhook*.\t\t\n\t![](./images/image13.png)\n\n## Step 5: Test it out by committing a change\n\n1. Click *Code* to return to the repo.\n\n\t![](./images/image14.png)\n\t\n1. Click *mq/basic*.\n\n\t![](./images/image15.png)\n\t\n1. Click the file *config.mqsc* to open the file.\n\n\t![](./images/image16.png)\n\t\n1. Click the pencil icon to edit the file.\n\n\t![](./images/image17.png)\n\t\t\n1. Make a simple change like adding a local queue called **TEST**.\n\n\t![](./images/image19.png)\t\n1. Scroll down and click *Commit changes*. \n\n\t![](./images/image20.png)\t\n1. Return to the OpenShift console. Scroll down to *Pipelines*. Make sure you are in your workspace. Click the drop-down and select *Pipeline Runs*. Click the hyperlink for one of the runs. \n\n\t![](./images/image21.png)\t\n1. You can see that task *deploy-qm* was successful. It will be high-lighted with a green check mark. If it fails it will be highlighted red. Click *Logs*.\n\t\n\t![](./images/image22.png)\n\n1. The display will be at the end of the log where you can see the deployment of the queue manager. You can also click *Expand* to make the log display full screen.\n\n\t![](./images/image25.png)\n\t\n1. Open another web browser tab and click the bookmark for *Cloud Pak Platform Nav...*\n\n\t![](./images/image26.png)\n\t\n1. The *Platform Navigator* opens with *Capabilities*. Click *Show less* hyperlink to conserve screen space. Click *Runtimes*.\n\n\t![](./images/image27.png)\n\t\n1. You will find your queue manager among others. If status shows *Pending* wait until it shows *Ready*. When it show *Ready* click the hyperlink for your queue manager to access the MQ Console.\n\n\t![](./images/image28.png)\n\t\n1. Once you are in the console you can verify your changes are there. Check that your changes are included. For example, if you added the local queue **TEST** make sure it now appears in the local queues display.\n\n\t![](./images/image29.png)\n\t\t\n## Congratulations\n\nYou have completed this lab MQ Tekton Pipelines.\n\n## Cleanup\n\n1.
